I made this out of neccessity to consolidate all my mobile reacharge info like data pack, per-day limit and cost at one place instead of endlessly reading emails. Its helpful for budgeting. It turned to be quite a learning experience.
I learnt about:
1. Text encodings - UTF8, 
2. Regular Expressions
3. Credentials can be stored in tokens.
4. Uploading working file on github without exposing secrets.
